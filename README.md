**A playful little website I designed during some spare time in class.**
I had just discovered Flexbox (and was very into using borders to visualize layout... cute). The entire design was built completely from scratch, and looking back, I’m actually really proud of what my early web-dev self pulled off. It’s a fun snapshot of how far I’ve come since then.
